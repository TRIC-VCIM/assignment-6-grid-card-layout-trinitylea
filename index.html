               <img src="images/godfather.jpg" alt="The Godfather Original Movie Poster" />
               <p> The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone
                  mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's
                  wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II
                  Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be
                  uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a
                  powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect
                  but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful
                  and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's
                  influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is
                  a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways
                  which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant
                  in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia
                  families which could tear the Corleone family apart. </p>

               <p> The defense and the prosecution have rested and the jury is
                  filing into the jury room to decide if a young man is guilty
                  or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an
                  open-and-shut case of murder soon becomes a detective story
                  that presents a succession of clues creating doubt, and a
                  mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and
                  preconceptions about the trial, the accused, and each other.
                  Based on the play, all of the action takes place on the stage
                  of the jury room. </p>

                  who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the
